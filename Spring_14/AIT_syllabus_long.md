## Course outline

1. Basics: Information and Computation
    - Information and codes
    - Random variables and dynamical systems
    - Computability
    - Turing machines
    - Finite automata

2. Entropy
    - Origins of entropy in physics: thermodynamics
    - Shannon's information theoretic entropy
    - Entropy in dynamical systems
    - Algorithmic entropy: Kolmogorov complexity

3. Complexity
    - Algorithmic randomness: finite strings
    - Algorithmic randomness: infinite strings
    - Randomness vs entropy
    - Typicality: generic points in dynamical systems
    - Randomness vs typicality
    - Normality and finite automata	

4. Coding and Data Compression
    - Universal codes
    - Compression and entropy
    - Lossless data compression: Lempel-Ziv compression
    - Lossy compression: rate distortion theory
	- Compressors as approximations to Kolmogorov complexity
	
5. Applications
    - Fractal dimension, entropy, and Kolmogorov complexity
    - Inductive inference via Kolmogorov complexity, Minimum Description Length principle
	- Clustering by data compression

## Course resources

The following web services will be used for this class:

- This course page: [http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_14/AIT_syllabus_long.html](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_14/AIT_syllabus_long.html)
- The [Angel page](https://cms.psu.edu) for the course.
- The [Piazza page](https://piazza.com/psu/spring2014/math574/home) for the course. Piazza is an online discussion board for courses and has math editing capability built in. 
- Penn State's online meeting platform: [https://meeting.psu.edu](https://meeting.psu.edu). Here we will meet during off-weeks for discussions and office hours.



## Course schedule

**All lectures for this class will be online**, posted on this page, on Angel, and on Piazza. The material will be presented in lessons (roughly 10-12). Each lesson comprises a number of short lecture videos (5 - 15 minutes each). Students are expected to complete one lesson each week (roughly).

We will use the class meetings for discussions, problem sessions, and some complementary material.
*Class meetings will be bi-weekly*, and announced in a timely manner.
In off weeks, we will meet on Penn State's online meeting platform: [https://meeting.psu.edu](https://meeting.psu.edu)

You can subscribe to the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/f1mh3u7uaf9a632rovuuc40jac%40group.calendar.google.com/private-1bc5c84efe2e2de721a92fd0a4014e69/basic.ics) for the course to keep track of the schedule.


## Student activities

To successfully complete the course, students are expected to do the following:

- Hand in solutions to homework assignments (biweekly).
- Take short quizzes on Angel related to each lecture.
- Participate in the weekly challenge on Piazza. 
- Participate in Piazza discussions. Ask good questions and answer questions by others.
- Produce a nice write-up of one lesson (in LaTeX) by the end of the semester.

		<em>Course webpage:</em> This site is mainly for documetary purposes. The course material (homework, sample exams, etc.) will be posted on <em>bSpace</em>. The course site will also has a chat room. I encourage you to make use of it. Go to <a href="http://bspace.berkeley.edu">http://bspace.berkeley.edu</a> and log on with your Calnet ID. Then  select the tab "<em>MATH 125A Fa08</em>". </p>


		<h3>Content</h3>
		
		<p>Propositional logic; predicate logic, syntax of first order logic, semantics, structures, satisfaction relation; logic of first order structures, substructures and elementary substructures, definable sets, example: dense linear orders; the Loewenheim-Skolem-Theorem; Goedel Completeness Theorem, Henkin constructions;  the Compactness Theorem, types; quantifier elimination, examples: dense linear orders, real closed fields; incompleteness, Goedel's Theorems</P>
	
	
		
		<h3>Text</h3>
		<p>We will use lecture notes by Slaman and Woodin. These are provided on the bSpace site for the course.
			
		<P><em>Supplementary reading.</em> There are many introductory logic texts. Two frequently used ones are <em>Enderton's A Mathematical Introduction to Logic</em>, and <em>Mathematical Logic by Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas</em>. Both are good texts, and I certainly recommend looking at them if you want a different angle on some material of the course. If you want to delve deeper into the many aspects of mathematical logic, take a look at <em>Shoenfield's Mathematical Logic</em>. This is quite an old book, and aimed rather at the graduate level, but there are still few texts that can keep up with this classic.</P>
		
		
		
		<h3>Exams</h3>
		<p>There will be <em>one midterm</em> in class: <em>Thursday, Oct 16</em>. 
		If you miss the midterm with a valid excuse, your score in the final exam will count for 75% of the grade. There will be <em>no makeup exams</em>.</p>
		
		<P>The final exam is held on <em>Friday, December 19, 1230-330pm</em>, room TBA</P>

		<p>
		All exams will be <em>closed book exams</em>. <em>No cheat sheets!</em> Bring blue books.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Homework</h3>
		<p>Homework will be assigned on Thursday and will be <em>due on the
		following Thursday</em> in class. Homework will be graded and the
		two lowest scores will be dropped. Late homework will not be accepted. There will be <em>no exception</em> to this rule. Of course it may happen that you cannot turn in homework because you were ill or for some other valid reason. This is why the two lowest scores will be dropped.</p>

		<p><font size=-1>A note on <em>academic honesty</em>: Collaboration among
		students to solve homework assignments is welcome. This is a good way
		to learn mathematics. So is the consultation of other sources such as
		other textbooks. However, <em>every student has to hand in an own set
		of solutions</em>, and if you use other people's work or ideas you
		<em>should indicate the source in your solutions</em>. <br /> (In any
		case, complete and correct homework receives full credit.)</font></p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Course Grade</h3>
		<p>The final grade will be determined as follows: <em> 25% homework, 25% midterm, 50% final exam</em>.</p>

		<em>Course webpage:</em> This site is mainly for documetary purposes. The course material (homework, sample exams, etc.) will be posted on <em>bSpace</em>. The course site will also has a chat room. I encourage you to make use of it. Go to <a href="http://bspace.berkeley.edu">http://bspace.berkeley.edu</a> and log on with your Calnet ID. Then  select the tab "<em>MATH 136 Sp10</em>". </p>

		<em>Supplementary reading.</em>
			<p>G. Boolos, J. Burgess, R. Jeffrey, Computability and Logic, Cambridge University Press, 2007 </p>
			 <p>S. B. Cooper, Computability Theory, Chapman-Hall, 2003 (more extensive than Cutland, covers advanced topics - good supplementary reading if the subject really interests you)</p>
			<p>H. Rogers, Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability, MIT Press, 1987 (excellent graduate text, many exercises)
			<p>J. Shoenfield, Mathematical Logic, AK Peters, 2001 (classic logic text on the graduate level, still a benchmark)
			<p>M. Sipser, Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Course Technology, 2005 (excellent book, different scope than our course, more emphasis on formal languages and complexity, particularly suited for computer scientists)</p>
			
		
		
		
		<h3>Exams</h3>
		<p>There will be <em>two midterms</em> in class: <em>Wednesday, Feb 17</em> and <em>Wednesday, Mar 31</em>. 
		If you miss the midterm with a valid excuse, your score in the other midterm will count double. There will be <em>no makeup exams</em>.</p>
		
		<P>The final exam is held on <em> Wednesday, May 12, 2010   7-10P</em>, room TBA</P>

		<p>
		All exams will be <em>closed book exams</em>. <em>No cheat sheets!</em> Bring blue books.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Homework</h3>
		<p>Homework will be assigned on (TBA) and will be <em>due on the
		following (TBA)</em> in class. Homework will be graded and the
		two lowest scores will be dropped. Late homework will not be accepted. There will be <em>no exception</em> to this rule. Of course it may happen that you cannot turn in homework because you were ill or for some other valid reason. This is why the two lowest scores will be dropped.</p>

		<p><font size=-1>A note on <em>academic honesty</em>: Collaboration among
		students to solve homework assignments is welcome. This is a good way
		to learn mathematics. So is the consultation of other sources such as
		other textbooks. However, <em>every student has to hand in an own set
		of solutions</em>, and if you use other people's work or ideas you
		<em>should indicate the source in your solutions</em>. <br /> (In any
		case, complete and correct homework receives full credit.)</font></p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Course Grade</h3>
		<p>The final grade will be determined as follows: <em> 20% homework, 20% each midterm, 40% final exam</em>.</p>

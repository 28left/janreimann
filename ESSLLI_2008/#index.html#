		<h3>Course Description</h3>
		
		<p>The course aims to give a thorough introduction to
		effective randomness, a currently very active field of
		research in mathematical logic and theoretical
		computer science with still many open questions. It is
		possible to introduce students to the  main lines of research in a rather short time. The five lectures will cover: 
			
			<ol>
				<li> The Cantor space, Lebesgue
				measure on Cantor space,
				Martin-L&ouml;f tests, basic
				properties of random sequences,betting
				games and martingales, equivalence of
				Martin-L&ouml; tests and effective
				martingales. 

         
				<li>  Kolmogorov complexity and the
				invariance theorem, basic properties
				of C, incompressibility and randomness
				oscillations, prefix-free complexity
				K, Schnorr's Theorem, the ample excess
				theorem, Chaitin's &Omega;.

			  <li> Computational properties of random
			  sequences, extracting information from
			  random sequences, relative randomness, van
			  Lambalgen's Theorem, K-triviality and lowness. 
					
				<li> Randomness for arbitrary
				distributions, Bernoulli measures,
				Hausdorff measures and dimension,
				randomness and fractal geometry.

			  <li> Stronger and weaker notions of
				randomness, randomness and
				computational complexity, arithmetical
				randomness, projective randomness,
				Solovay random reals, randomness and
				determinacy, connections with the
				higher infinite.
			</ol>
			</p> 
		

		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
		
 		<p>Basic knowledge in Computability Theory (Turing machines, computably enumerable sets) and Mathematical Logic (basic set theory.<p>
	
	
		
		<h3>Reading</h3>

		<p> All <b>slides</b> will be posted here.</p>
			<ol>
			  <li><a href="Randomness_ESSLLI_2008_Lecture_1.pdf" >Slides Lecture 1</a> <\li>
  			  <li><a href="Randomness_ESSLLI_2008_Lecture_2.pdf" >Slides Lecture 2</a>

			  </li>
			</ol>
		

			
		<p>Furthermore, there are <b>lecture notes</b> covering certain
		aspects of the course in more detail </p>

		<ol>
			  <li><a href="randomness_lecture_notes_2008_lecture_1.pdf" >Lecture Notes on Martin-L&ouml; Tests and Martingales</a>

			  </li>
			</ol>

			
		<P><em>Supplementary reading.</em> There is a standard reference, the book <em>An introduction to Kolmogorov complexity</em> by M. Li and P. Vitanyi, Springer, 1997. There are  to appear two new books containing a lot of new important results - one by A. Nies, (Auckland), and the other by R. Downey (Wellington) and D. Hirschfeldt (Chicago). Should they be available before the course starts I will indicate this here.</P>

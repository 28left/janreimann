		<h3>Text</h3>
		<p>J. J. Rotman, A first course in abstract algebra, 3rd edition, Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006.<br>
		</p>



		<h3>Content</h3>
		
		<p>The basic theory of the three basic algebraic structures: groups, rings, and fields. Below is approximate schedule of topics.<br>
		<iframe src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showNav=0&amp;showDate=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=1800&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=tjiqbdhr2ntf4tu769gtjg2870%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%23853104&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York" style=" border-width:0 " width="800" height="2000" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
		</P>


		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
		
		The official prerequisite for the course is Math 311W or Math 315. That means I expect you to be familiar with rigorous mathematical proofs. You should have practiced some basic proof techniques such as induction, proof by contradiction, etc. Most proofs we will do in this class are neither long nor hard, so you will have the opportunity to further practice proving mathematical statements. Furthermore, you should know about basic mathematical structures such as sets and functions, and the accordant notation. 
		
		If you have taken neither 311 nor 315, please talk to me as soon as possible, so we can figure out if this is the right course for you.

			<p>G. Boolos, J. Burgess, R. Jeffrey, Computability and Logic, Cambridge University Press, 2007 </p>
			 <p>S. B. Cooper, Computability Theory, Chapman-Hall, 2003 (more extensive than Cutland, covers advanced topics - good supplementary reading if the subject really interests you)</p>
			<p>H. Rogers, Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability, MIT Press, 1987 (excellent graduate text, many exercises)
			<p>J. Shoenfield, Mathematical Logic, AK Peters, 2001 (classic logic text on the graduate level, still a benchmark)
			<p>M. Sipser, Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Course Technology, 2005 (excellent book, different scope than our course, more emphasis on formal languages and complexity, particularly suited for computer scientists)</p>

		<h3>Exams</h3>
		<p>There will be <em>two midterms</em> in class: <em>Wednesday, Sep 29</em> and <em>Wednesday, Nov 3</em>. 
		If you miss the midterm with a valid excuse, your score in the other midterm will count double. <em>Makeup exams</em> will only be given under very special circumstances.</p>
		
		<P>The final exam date will be announced in September.</P>

		<p>
		All exams will be <em>closed book exams</em>. <em>No cheat sheets!</em> Bring blue books.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Homework</h3>
		<p>Homework will be assigned each Friday and will be <em>due in class the
		following Friday</em> in class. Homework will be graded and the
		two lowest scores will be dropped. Late homework will not be accepted. There will be <em>no exception</em> to this rule. Of course it may happen that you cannot turn in homework because you were ill or for some other valid reason. This is why the two lowest scores will be dropped.</p>

		<h3>Course Grade</h3>
		<p>The final grade will be determined as follows: <em> 20% homework, 20% each midterm, 40% final exam</em>.</p>


		<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>	
		All <a href="http://www.psu.edu/ufs/policies/">Penn State Policies</a> regarding ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course.
		
		<p><em>Collaboration</em>: Collaboration among
		students to solve homework assignments is welcome. This is a good way
		to learn mathematics. So is the consultation of other sources such as
		other textbooks. However, <em>every student has to hand in an own set
		of solutions</em>, and if you use other people's work or ideas you
		<em>have to indicate the source in your solutions</em>. <br /> (In any	case, complete and correct homework receives full credit.)</font></p>

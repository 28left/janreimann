		<em>Course webpage:</em> This site is mainly for documetary purposes. The course material (homework, sample exams, etc.) will be posted on <em>bSpace</em>. The course site will also has a chat room. I encourage you to make use of it. Go to <a href="http://bspace.berkeley.edu">http://bspace.berkeley.edu</a> and log on with your Calnet ID. Then  select the tab "<em>MATH 227B Fa09</em>". </p>


		<h3>Content</h3>
		
		<p><em>Degree Theory</em>: algebraic (structure of partial order of degrees) and logical (theory of (D,v,&le;)), global and local (automorphisms, definability, r.e. and Delta^0_2 degrees), techniques (forcing, determinacy, permitting, priority arguments, full approximation); <em>Hierarchies</em>: jump operator, arithmetical hierarchy, high-/lowness, pseudo-jump operators, second-order arithmetic, effective descriptive set theory, recursive ordinals, hyperarithmetical sets, Kleene's O, hyperjump and beyond, set theoretical hierarchies; <em>algorithmic randomness</em>: information theoretic complexity, information theoretic "halting problem", lowness notions, information theoretic vs computational complexity, randomness and genericity. </P>
	
	
		
		<h3>Text</h3>
		<p>We will use either freely available books or lecture notes, or original research articles. These (or links to them) will be posted on the bSpace site for the course.
			
		<P><em>Supplementary reading.</em> standard recursion theory texts: Soare, Odifreddi, Rogers</P>
		
		
		
		<h3>Exams</h3>
